🤝 MeetUp App

Welcome to the MeetUp App! 👋

This is a project I built to explore how people connect and organize events online. As I grow my skills as a developer, I wanted to create something that wasn't just a static page, but a tool that handles real-world interaction—like listing events and helping users find their community.

🌟 What does it do?

The MeetUp App is all about making it easy to see what’s happening nearby. Here are the core features:

• Event Showcasing: A clean, organized layout to browse through various meetups and gatherings.

• Detail-Oriented: Each event has its own space for descriptions, locations, and dates.

• User-Centric Design: I focused on making the navigation feel natural—like an app you'd actually use to plan your weekend.

• Dynamic Lists: The app maps through event data to generate cards, so the UI updates automatically.

🛠️ The Tech Stack

I used a modern toolkit to bring this project to life:

• React – To build a fast, component-based user interface.

• JavaScript (ES6+) – The "brain" of the app, handling the logic and data.

• CSS / Bootstrap – To make sure everything is styled beautifully and works on all screen sizes.

• MERN Stack Knowledge – This project is part of my journey in mastering MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js.

🚀 How to get it running

If you want to try it out on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/Latisha0102/MeetUp-App.git

cd MeetUp-App

2. Install the dependencies
   
Get all the necessary packages installed:

npm install

3. Start the project
   
Run it in your browser:

npm start

The app should pop up at http://localhost:3000. 🎉

🚧 My Learning Journey

While working on the MeetUp App, I focused heavily on:

1. UI/UX Flow: Thinking like a user—is it easy to find an event? Is the information clear?
2. Reusable Components: Building "Event Cards" that can be reused for any meetup.
3. State Logic: Learning how to manage and display data dynamically within a React application.
